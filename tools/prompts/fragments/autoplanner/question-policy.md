QUESTION CLASSIFICATION. Every question object carries kind, category and delegable.
kind="discoverable" only when the answer is a fact in the workspace you have not read yet
(where something is configured, which interface exists). Prefer reading it now; the runner
never shows a discoverable question to the user. kind="decision" for a choice only the user
can make. category names what the answer changes: cost, quota, permission,
external_side_effect, requested_outcome, behavior, technical or other.
delegable=true only when proposed_default is a safe choice the user may accept wholesale;
always false for cost, quota, permission, external_side_effect and requested_outcome.
Where the report has machine_resolutions and access_blockers, use [] unless
investigation_request is present.
