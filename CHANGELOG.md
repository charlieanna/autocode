## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Operational pauses retain their recovery authority through queued feedback
  and pause requests; unrelated budget flags and historical job-failure
  records cannot authorize an unscoped retry (#661).

## [0.7.1] — 2026-10-09

The first tagged release. AutoCode runs a coding agent through planning,
approval, implementation and independent validation, and does not report
completion without evidence.

### Added

- **Original-brief acceptance** (#452, #617, #669, #672, #742): a `one per line`
  CLI output format is checked line by line, with optional exact/absent items,
  against a runner replay — not only the Planner's criteria.
- **Verdict taxonomy** (#455, #738): `stop_class` on every scenario result
  (false completion, safety stop, provider failure, harness failure, budget).
- **Reliability table** (#694, #750): a generated dated table in
  `docs/reliability-table.md` and a short copy on the README; live and fake
  rows never mixed.
- **`autocode explain`** (#715, #788): plain-English explanation of why a run
  stopped, what it means, and what each offered command does.
- **`autocode merge`** (#724, #789): deliver a task worktree's branch into the
  base; a moved base is refused with the re-validate step.
- **Provider conformance matrix** (#706, #790): `docs/providers.md` names the
  engine versions the offline suite has run against; `doctor` reports the
  installed one, or honest `untested`.
- **Property tests** (#705, #745): no generated state may complete without
  evidence (completion gate, brief literals, regression judge, tokens).
- **Secret redaction** (#712, #786): credentials never leave the run directory
  in a PR body or export; the raw capture stays intact.

### Fixed

- A parallel Builder's model stop has one way forward after corrective
  information (#541, #683).
- A `{"cmd": …}` final message is a known provider defect: never accepted as a
  report, never executed (#512, #735).
- Probe containment is unavailable off macOS: the classification becomes an
  untestable advisory instead of parking the run (#667, #743).
- A packed-ref `branch -D` no longer trips the tip guard on older Git (#668, #743).
- The completion gate refuses a COMPLETE whose runner observation is missing,
  including under `glm_first_v1` routing (#451, #740).

### Changed

- A new task runs in its own Git worktree by default; `--in-place` opts out
  (#724). The person's checkout stays usable while the Builder works.
